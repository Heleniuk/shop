Task1. Added product, product-list and cart components. Implemented "Add to Cart" and "Remove from Cart" functions.
Task4. Added date, currency and uppercase pipes to product.component.html. Async Pipe is in the product-list.component.html.The custom orderBy pipe is used in cart.component.html.
Task5. Split app into feature modules: Products, Orders, Cart, Admin.
Implemented:
    - orders create and read operations via localStorage
    - products CRUD operations (in-memory only, alas)
    - reviews read operation in a secondary outlet
Styles still look ugly. I am sorry.
